    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>During grilling season, I make this Grilled Chicken for my family at least once a week. It’s one of those simple recipes that works for even the pickiest eaters! I brine large chicken breasts, then coat them in a sweet and savory spice rub to create the juiciest grilled chicken you’ve ever tasted! Everyone at my house loves this chicken, and the delicious char from grilling takes the flavor to the next level.</p>
    <p>Juicy grilled chicken is a staple at my house this time of year. I never have to worry if my picky toddler will finish her dinner or if my husband will go back for seconds. It’s one of the magical recipes that’s a winner every time. The best part is, the leftovers are great to use in just about every Budget Bytes chicken salad recipe we have on the blog which makes lunches the rest of the week a no-brainer. To top it all off, using the grill means my house isn’t sweltering hot in the middle of the summer! Need I say more?</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>Here’s what you’ll need to make grilled chicken:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken: I like large boneless skinless chicken breasts for this recipe. They’re easy to divide in half and pound nice and thin for a tender bite. I grabbed a 2-pack that weighed in at 1.61 lbs. so there was plenty of chicken for everyone.</li>
        <li>Brine: A simple mixture of kosher salt, granulated sugar, and water infuses the chicken with flavor, helps to combat moisture loss, and makes the meat super tender.</li>
        <li>Spice Rub: A blend of salt, pepper, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, smoked paprika, onion powder, and brown sugar creates a savory, spicy, and smoky flavor with just a hint of sweetness.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Create your wet brine: Combine 1/4 cup kosher salt and 1/4 cup granulated sugar in 2 quarts of cold water. Whisk to combine.</li>
        <li>With a fork, poke holes all over the chicken breasts and then transfer to a Ziplock bag. Pound chicken breasts to 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch with a tenderizing mallet or rolling pin inside a Ziplock bag.</li>
        <li>Pour the wet brine into the Ziplock bag with the tenderized chicken breasts. Close the bag and allow it to brine at room temperature for 30 minutes, or in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours.</li>
        <li>Make the seasoning blend by combining the salt, pepper, cayenne, garlic powder, smoked paprika, onion powder, and brown sugar in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Remove the chicken breasts from the brine, rinse, and pat dry on both sides with paper towels, drizzle with olive oil, and rub with the seasoning blend on both sides.</li>
        <li>Preheat grill to 475°F. Note: If you are using an indoor grill, we found putting the chicken on the grill while it’s preheating helps get the middle of the breast to temperature in a timely manner and keeps the outside from overcooking and burning. If your chicken has been in the refrigerator, allow it to come to room temperature for at least 10 minutes before starting the grilling process.</li>
        <li>Cook the chicken for 5-7 minutes on each side, or until the internal temp reads between 155-160°F. The chicken will continue to cook while it’s resting (because it’s so hot and juicy!) so you can remove it a little early, just make sure it reaches the internal temperature of 165°F while resting, or you may need to throw it back on the grill for a couple more minutes.</li>
    </ol>
